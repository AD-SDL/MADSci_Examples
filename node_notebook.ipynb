    "## What is a Node?\n",
    "\n",
    "- In MADSci, a `Node` refers to a single instrument, sensor, robot, or other device, combined with the software needed to control, operate, automate, and integrate it into the Automated or Autonomous Lab as a whole.\n",
    "- Node's take **Action Requests**, and return **Action Results**. They also report **State** and **Status**, **Node Info**, and can optionally manage **Resources**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./assets/drawio/node.drawio.svg\" alt=\"Diagram illustratring how a node intermediates between a User and different devices\" width=1000 style=\"background-color: white\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anatomy of a Node\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Node` typically consists of the following sub-components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A physical **device** (robot, instrument, sensor, etc.)\n",
    "- A **driver**, API, library, or software application for communicating with that device, often provided by the hardware vendor\n",
    "- A device **interface** class that handles the neccessary initialization, communication, and cleanup required to use the given device\n",
    "- The **node implementation**, typically a class, which uses the interface to handle the execution of the actions and the lifecycle of the node (state, status, statup, shutdown, etc.).\n",
    "- The **node definition** and **configuration**, which define specific details about a given instance of a node and how it should. We typically implement these as .YAML files\n",
    "- The **node server** and **node client**, which allow for standardized control of nodes. These are implementations of the MADSci Node standard interface, and operate using standard protocols (currently, REST-based HTTP)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./assets/drawio/node_detail.drawio.svg\" alt=\"Diagram of the components of a MADSci Node\" width=1000 style=\"background-color: white\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Node Instances vs. Node Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, we need to disambiguate between \"this particular Node, tied to a specific device\" and \"this class of Node, tied to this type of device\". We usually refer to the former as a **Node Instance**, and the latter as a **Node Module** when we need to be precise.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we might have one \"Opentrons OT-2\" **Node Module** that we've written, which we then use to run 2 different **Node Instances** in the lab: \"OT-2 Alpha\" and \"OT-2 Beta\""

    "## Defining A Node\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can build a MADSci compliant Node entirely from scratch, that's a lot of work. To save you some time and effort, we've implemented our own `RestNode` python class that you can inherit from as the basis for defining a device's Node.\n",

    "### Node Definition Files\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the code that makes up a Node Module's implementation, an individual instance of a Node has a `NodeDefinition`, which includes all the configuration and information for a **single, specific instance** of a device. We generally store this definition as a `.yaml` file that is then passed as an argument when we start the Node server.\n",

    "### Node Config\n",
    "\n",
    "The `NodeConfig` class is a class we define for a Node that, as the name implies, defines the configuration available for a specific Node. This often includes things like device identifiers or IP addresses, initialization arguments to pass to the device's driver, or details about the specific device being controlled. It also includes common configurations for the node itself, such as how to configure the REST server for the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define our `NodeConfig` as a Pydantic Dataclass, and have a `RestNodeConfig` we can use as a base class with default configuration for the REST server.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the advantages of defining our `NodeConfig` in this way is that we can set configuration values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- As part of the `NodeDefinition`, using the `config_overrides` field\n",
    "- Using command-line parameters, when we start the Node\n",
    "- Using the `set_config` endpoint on a running Node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Device Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the devices we need to automate have their own DLL's, API's, Libraries, or other means of controlling and communicating with them. The exact details, capabilities, and implementations vary wildly from device to device, but in most cases these are complex enough to justify their own wrapper class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing the device specific logic as a standalone class provides two key advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can use the device interface standalone, for testing and debugging, maintenance, or in applications where we can't or don't want to use a full Node.\n",
    "- We separate the concerns of managing the node from the nuts and bolts of interfacing with the device.\n",
    "\n",

    "- `shutdown_handler`: a user-defined function that handles the logic of shutting the node down: disconnecting from the device, cleaning up system resources, etc.\n",

Unlike actions, admin commands have pre-defined behavior, and the node developer chooses whether and how to implement a specific admin command for a given device in the node. The MADSci Node Standard supports the following admin commands:\n",

    "- `pause`: pause the current action, if any\n",
    "- `resume`: resume the current action, if any\n",
    "- `lock`: refuse to accept new actions\n",

    "- `cancel`: cancel the current action\n",
    "- `reset`: clear errors, reinitialize the node, and reset the status\n",
    "- `stop`: a more aggressive cancellation--halt immediately and trigger any safety/e-stop of the device\n",
    "- `shutdown`: disconnect from the device and stop the node's server\n"
