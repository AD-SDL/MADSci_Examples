# MADSci Examples

This repository provides example notebooks to teach the core concepts behind [the Modular Autonomous Discovery for Science (MADSci) Framework](https://github.com/AD-SDL/MADSci).

You can run these notebooks in the following ways:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)
- [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- [Using Jupyter](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/stable/start/)

## Notebooks

- [Node Notebook](./node_notebook.ipynb): walks through using MADSci's Node standard to automate and integrate your devices into an automated or autonomous laboratory.
- [Experiment Notebook](./experiment_notebook.ipynb): walks through writing your own autonomous experiment using MADSci's Experiment Application (note: this notebook assumes that you have a running MADSci lab)
